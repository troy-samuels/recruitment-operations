# Drag and Drop Debug Steps

## To test the drag and drop issue:

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Open the browser's Developer Console (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console)
3. Try to drag a card from one column to another
4. Watch the console logs for:
   - 🚀 DRAG START
   - 🔍 DragOver Debug
   - 🏁 DragEnd Debug
   - Any error messages

## Expected behavior:
- Cards should be draggable between all 4 columns
- When hovering over a column, it should highlight (blue background)
- When dropping, the card should move to the new column

## Current issues to investigate:
1. Check if drag events are firing
2. Check if drop zones are being detected
3. Check for any JavaScript errors
