# ‚úÖ DNS Configured - Final Steps to Complete

**Date:** October 1, 2025, 9:55 PM
**Status:** DNS ‚úÖ | Domain Assignment Required ‚è≥

## üéâ Great News - DNS is Working!

Your nameservers are correctly pointing to Vercel:
```
ns1.vercel-dns.com ‚úÖ
ns2.vercel-dns.com ‚úÖ
```

DNS records are also propagated:
- `jobwall.co.uk` ‚Üí `216.150.1.65, 216.150.1.129` ‚úÖ
- `www.jobwall.co.uk` ‚Üí `216.150.1.193, 216.150.1.65` ‚úÖ

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue: Redirect Loop

**Problem Detected:**
- `https://jobwall.co.uk` ‚Üí redirects to `https://www.jobwall.co.uk` (307) ‚ùå
- `https://www.jobwall.co.uk` ‚Üí redirects to `https://jobwall.co.uk` (308) ‚úÖ

This creates a redirect loop because:
1. Apex redirects to www
2. WWW redirects back to apex
3. Loop continues...

**Root Cause:**
The domain `jobwall.co.uk` is in Vercel DNS but not properly assigned to the `recruitment-operations` project as the **primary production domain**.

---

## üéØ Solution: Add Domains via Vercel Dashboard

Since the domain is managed by Vercel DNS but assigned elsewhere (or not assigned to this project), you need to add it via the dashboard.

### Step 1: Go to Domains Settings

**URL:** https://vercel.com/troy-blairandbowes-projects/recruitment-operations/settings/domains

Or navigate manually:
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Click on `recruitment-operations` project
3. Click "Settings" tab
4. Click "Domains" in left sidebar

---

### Step 2: Add Apex Domain (Primary)

1. **In the "Add Domain" field, enter:**
   ```
   jobwall.co.uk
   ```

2. **Click "Add"**

3. **Vercel will show one of these:**

   **Scenario A:** Domain is in Vercel DNS
   - ‚úÖ Vercel will auto-configure it
   - ‚úÖ No additional DNS setup needed
   - ‚úÖ SSL certificate auto-provisions

   **Scenario B:** Domain conflict detected
   - You'll see: "Domain is assigned to another project"
   - **Solution:** Click "Transfer Domain" or "Remove from other project"
   - Select to transfer to `recruitment-operations`

   **Scenario C:** Needs verification
   - Vercel will ask to verify ownership
   - Since nameservers are already pointing to Vercel, this should auto-verify

4. **Wait for SSL certificate provisioning** (usually 1-2 minutes)

---

### Step 3: Add WWW Domain (Redirect)

1. **In the "Add Domain" field, enter:**
   ```
   www.jobwall.co.uk
   ```

2. **Click "Add"**

3. **Vercel will likely:**
   - Auto-detect it should redirect to apex
   - Configure it as a 308 redirect to `jobwall.co.uk`
   - This is already configured in `next.config.js` lines 3-14

---

### Step 4: Set Apex as Primary (If Needed)

After adding both domains, verify the primary domain:

1. **Look for the domain marked as "Production"**
2. **If `www.jobwall.co.uk` is marked as primary:**
   - Click the three dots (...) next to `jobwall.co.uk`
   - Select "Set as Primary" or "Use for Production"
3. **Ensure `jobwall.co.uk` (apex) is the production domain**

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Result After Configuration

Once completed, you should see:

**In Vercel Dashboard:**
```
‚úÖ jobwall.co.uk (Production) [Primary]
‚úÖ www.jobwall.co.uk ‚Üí Redirect to jobwall.co.uk
```

**When Testing:**
```bash
# Apex domain serves the app
curl -I https://jobwall.co.uk
# Expected: HTTP/2 200 OK

# WWW redirects to apex
curl -I https://www.jobwall.co.uk
# Expected: HTTP/2 308 ‚Üí Location: https://jobwall.co.uk/
```

## üîç Current Configuration Status

### ‚úÖ What's Already Working

- ‚úÖ Nameservers point to Vercel
- ‚úÖ DNS records propagated globally
- ‚úÖ SSL certificates available from Vercel
- ‚úÖ Application deployed to production
- ‚úÖ 11 environment variables configured
- ‚úÖ `next.config.js` has www ‚Üí apex redirect logic
- ‚úÖ `vercel.json` has production configuration
- ‚úÖ Security headers configured

### ‚è≥ What Needs to Be Done

- ‚è≥ Add `jobwall.co.uk` to project via dashboard
- ‚è≥ Add `www.jobwall.co.uk` to project via dashboard
- ‚è≥ Set `jobwall.co.uk` as primary production domain
- ‚è≥ Wait for SSL certificate provisioning (1-2 minutes)

## üö® Why CLI Can't Do This

The Vercel CLI returns this error:
```
Error: Cannot add jobwall.co.uk since it's already assigned to another project.
```

This means:
1. The domain exists in Vercel DNS system
2. It might be assigned to another project (possibly a default/placeholder)
3. Only the dashboard can transfer/reassign it to the correct project

**This is a limitation of the CLI** - domain transfers require dashboard access.

---

## üîê Security Headers Already Configured

Once the domain is properly assigned, these headers will be active:

### All Routes:
```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

### API Routes:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://jobwall.co.uk
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,OPTIONS,PATCH,DELETE,POST,PUT
```

You can verify with:
```bash
curl -I https://www.jobwall.co.uk
```

**Current Status:** Security headers are already showing on www subdomain! ‚úÖ

---

## üìä DNS Verification

Current DNS status (confirmed working):

```bash
# Nameservers
$ dig NS jobwall.co.uk +short
ns1.vercel-dns.com.  ‚úÖ
ns2.vercel-dns.com.  ‚úÖ

# A records (apex)
$ dig jobwall.co.uk +short
216.150.1.65   ‚úÖ
216.150.1.129  ‚úÖ

# A records (www)
$ dig www.jobwall.co.uk +short
216.150.1.193  ‚úÖ
216.150.1.65   ‚úÖ
```

**DNS Propagation:** ‚úÖ Complete globally

## üéØ Quick Action Checklist

To complete the setup:

- [ ] Go to https://vercel.com/troy-blairandbowes-projects/recruitment-operations/settings/domains
- [ ] Add `jobwall.co.uk` as a domain
- [ ] Resolve any "already assigned" conflicts (transfer to this project)
- [ ] Add `www.jobwall.co.uk` as a domain
- [ ] Verify `jobwall.co.uk` is set as primary/production domain
- [ ] Wait 1-2 minutes for SSL certificate
- [ ] Test: `curl -I https://jobwall.co.uk` (should return 200)
- [ ] Test: `curl -I https://www.jobwall.co.uk` (should return 308)
- [ ] Test in browser: https://jobwall.co.uk
- [ ] Verify no console errors
- [ ] Test API endpoint: https://jobwall.co.uk/api/billing/status

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Domain already assigned to another project"

**Solution:**
1. Click "Transfer Domain" in the modal
2. Or remove it from the other project first
3. Then add it to `recruitment-operations`

### Issue: SSL certificate not provisioning

**Solution:**
1. Wait up to 5 minutes (usually takes 1-2 min)
2. Check domain verification status in dashboard
3. Ensure DNS is still pointing to Vercel nameservers

### Issue: Still seeing redirect loop

**Solution:**
1. Verify `jobwall.co.uk` (apex) is marked as "Production"
2. Verify `www.jobwall.co.uk` shows "‚Üí Redirect to jobwall.co.uk"
3. Clear browser cache or test in incognito mode
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for Vercel edge cache to update

---

## ‚úÖ Final Verification Steps

Once domains are added in dashboard:

```bash
# 1. Test apex domain (should return 200)
curl -I https://jobwall.co.uk

# 2. Test www redirect (should return 308)
curl -I https://www.jobwall.co.uk

# 3. Test API endpoint
curl https://jobwall.co.uk/api/billing/status

# 4. Test landing page loads
curl https://jobwall.co.uk | grep -i "Stop Losing Placements"

# 5. Check security headers
curl -I https://jobwall.co.uk | grep -E "(X-Frame|X-Content|X-XSS)"
```

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues adding the domain:

1. **Check which project has the domain:**
   - Go to https://vercel.com/troy-blairandbowes-projects
   - Look through projects for one showing `jobwall.co.uk`
   - Remove it from that project first

2. **Verify DNS:**
   ```bash
   dig NS jobwall.co.uk +short
   # Should show: ns1.vercel-dns.com, ns2.vercel-dns.com
   ```

3. **Contact Vercel Support:**
   - If domain transfer fails
   - Dashboard: Settings ‚Üí Support
   - Or: https://vercel.com/support
