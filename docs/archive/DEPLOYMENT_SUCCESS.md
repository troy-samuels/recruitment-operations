### ✅ API Routes Configured

$ curl -I https://jobwall.co.uk/api/billing/status

## 📊 **What Was Fixed**

**Problem:** Redirect loop (apex ↔ www)

**Root Cause:** Vercel had www as production domain

**Solution:** You configured domains in Vercel Dashboard:
- Set `jobwall.co.uk` as primary production domain ✅
- Set `www.jobwall.co.uk` to redirect to apex ✅

**Result:** No more redirect loop! Site is fully functional! 🎉
