- ‚úÖ Analytics data secured with workspace filtering
- ‚úÖ Lead capture forms secured (insert-only)

---

## üöÄ Quick Deployment (Production)

### Step 1: Backup Database (5 minutes)
```bash
# Via Supabase Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Database > Backups
# 2. Click "Create backup now"
# 3. Wait for confirmation
# OR use pg_dump if you have direct access
```

### Step 2: Apply Migration (5 minutes)
```bash
# Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
# 1. Go to SQL Editor
# 2. Create new query
# 3. Copy/paste contents of: database-schema-rls-fixes.sql
# 4. Click "Run"
# 5. Verify success messages in output

# Option B: Via Supabase CLI
supabase db push --file database-schema-rls-fixes.sql
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment (5 minutes)
Run verification queries from `RLS_VERIFICATION.md`:

```sql
-- Check all tables have RLS enabled
SELECT
    tablename,
    CASE
        WHEN c.relrowsecurity THEN '‚úÖ Enabled'
        ELSE '‚ùå DISABLED'
    END as rls_status
FROM pg_tables t
LEFT JOIN pg_class c ON c.relname = t.tablename
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
    AND tablename NOT LIKE 'pg_%'
ORDER BY rls_status, tablename;
```

**Expected**: All tables should show "‚úÖ Enabled"

### Step 4: Test with Real Users (10 minutes)
1. Log in as User A from Workspace A
2. Verify you can only see Workspace A data
3. Log in as User B from Workspace B
4. Verify you can only see Workspace B data
5. Verify User A cannot see User B's data

### Step 5: Monitor (Ongoing)
```bash
# Check Supabase logs for RLS policy violations
# Dashboard > Logs > Database
# Look for: "permission denied" or "RLS policy violation"
```

## üîê Security Model Overview

### Before (VULNERABLE)
```
‚ùå auto_task_rules: No RLS - Anyone could see all workspaces' rules
‚ùå client_response_stats: No RLS - Cross-workspace data leakage
‚ùå Materialized views: No protection - Analytics data exposed
‚ö†Ô∏è leads: No policies - Anyone could read pre-signup data
‚ö†Ô∏è workspace_subscriptions: Incomplete - Users could modify billing
```

### After (SECURED)
```
‚úÖ auto_task_rules: Workspace-scoped (users see only their rules)
‚úÖ client_response_stats: Workspace-scoped (no cross-workspace access)
‚úÖ Materialized views: Secure functions enforce workspace filtering
‚úÖ leads: INSERT-only for public, SELECT for service role only
‚úÖ workspace_subscriptions: Users read-only, service role modifies
‚úÖ workspaces: Users can create, admins can update
‚úÖ profiles: Users can create their own, update their own only
```

## üß™ Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] Database backup completed
- [ ] Read the migration script (`database-schema-rls-fixes.sql`)
- [ ] Staging environment tested (if available)
- [ ] Rollback script available (`rollback-rls-fixes.sql`)
- [ ] Team notified of deployment window
- [ ] Monitoring/alerting configured

---

## üîß Deployment Options

### Option 1: Zero-Downtime Deployment (Recommended)
RLS policies are applied instantly without locking tables.

```sql
-- Run database-schema-rls-fixes.sql via Supabase SQL Editor
-- No downtime required
-- Users may experience slight latency during policy evaluation
```

**Advantages**:
- No service interruption
- Fast deployment (<1 minute)
- Safe for production

**Disadvantages**:
- Cannot test rollback without affecting users

### Option 2: Maintenance Window Deployment
Schedule a brief maintenance window for maximum safety.

```bash
# 1. Put site in maintenance mode (2 minutes)
# 2. Apply migration (5 minutes)
# 3. Run verification queries (5 minutes)
# 4. Test with sample users (5 minutes)
# 5. Remove maintenance mode
# Total: 15-20 minutes
```

**Advantages**:
- Can thoroughly test before going live
- Easy rollback if issues found

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires user notification
- Brief service interruption

---

## üö® Rollback Procedure

If critical issues occur after deployment:

### Step 1: Assess Impact
- What is broken?
- Which users are affected?
- Is data still protected?

### Step 2: Execute Rollback (If Necessary)
```sql
-- Run rollback-rls-fixes.sql in Supabase SQL Editor
-- This will restore pre-migration state
-- WARNING: Re-introduces security vulnerabilities
```

### Step 3: Investigate Root Cause
- Check application logs
- Review user reports
- Test locally with same data

### Step 4: Fix and Re-Deploy
- Adjust policies as needed
- Test in staging
- Re-apply fixed migration

## üîç API Routes That Need Updates

After deploying RLS fixes, update these API routes to use secure wrapper functions:

### Analytics Routes (`/api/analytics/*`)

**Before:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå Direct materialized view access (no workspace filtering)
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('events_daily_counts')
  .select('*');
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Use secure wrapper function (workspace-scoped)
const { data } = await supabase
  .rpc('get_events_daily_counts', {
    p_start_date: startDate,
    p_end_date: endDate
  });
```

### Affected Files:
- `src/app/api/analytics/summary/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/analytics/timeseries/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/analytics/heatmap/route.ts`

---

## üí° Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "permission denied for table X"
**Cause**: User trying to access data outside their workspace
**Solution**: This is expected behavior - RLS is working correctly

### Issue: "User not associated with a workspace"
**Cause**: User profile missing workspace_id
**Solution**:
```sql
-- Check user's workspace
SELECT id, email, workspace_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();

-- Fix if needed (run as admin)
UPDATE profiles SET workspace_id = 'xxx' WHERE id = 'user-id';
```

### Issue: Stripe webhook failing
**Cause**: Service role key not configured
**Solution**: Ensure webhook uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` not anon key

### Issue: Analytics dashboard blank
**Cause**: Not using secure wrapper functions
**Solution**: Update API routes to use `get_events_*` functions

### Issue: Performance degradation
**Cause**: RLS subqueries not optimized
**Solution**:
```sql
-- Check query plan
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM roles WHERE workspace_id = 'xxx';

-- Add indexes if needed
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_roles_workspace_id ON roles(workspace_id);
```
